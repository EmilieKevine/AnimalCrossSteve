# 🎓 AnimalCrossSteve 
Introduction to Computer Graphics Project – 3D Scene

👥 Group Members: Adam BELLIK, Emilie Kevine KENGNI MBOU, Floriane TANG

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **"Introduction to Computer Graphics"** course. 
The goal was to design and implement an original 3D scene that integrates the concepts covered in class.

The final result is an interactive 3D scene featuring a controllable character, multiple imported models (including an animated one), and a dynamic environment.

## 🎨 Inspiration

This project **"AnimalCrossSteve"** was inspired by the artistic style of **"Animal Crossing"** and the humorous internet meme known as **"Poisson Steve"**.

The scene combines handmade elements with imported assets for textures and props. 

### ✅ Handmade Elements

- Character "Steve" modeled from scratch using primitives (spheres, cylinders, etc.)
- Custom shaders, animation logic, and scene graph hierarchy
- Manual composition and positioning of the scene

### 📦 Imported Assets

- **Textures for walls and floors**  
  Source: [Textures Resource](https://www.textures-resource.com/)  
  Used to create a realistic environment in the room.

- **3D models (non-animated props)**  
  Source: [Models Resource](https://www.models-resource.com/)  
  Used for some objects such as bed, sofa, guitar and clock.

## 📝 Features Demonstrated

| Feature            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modeling**       | Steve was modeled using primitive shapes and hierarchical node structure.   |
| **Texturing**      | Multiple textures applied to imported models and environment (skybox).      |
| **Lighting**       | Implemented Phong lighting on custom objects and models.                    |
| **Shaders**        | Custom GLSL shaders used (Phong, skybox, color-based).                      |
| **Animation**      | Object and character movement over time and user input.                     |
| **Camera System**  | Free camera navigation (ZQSD + mouse + space/ctrl).                         |

## 💡 Bonus Features

We implemented the following **bonus features** from the TPs:

- 🖱️ **Mouse-Controlled Camera**  
  Implemented a free-fly camera using mouse input (GLFW) to control orientation and enhance navigation.

- 📦 **Model Loading with Assimp**  
  Loaded complex 3D models (`.fbx`, `.dae`) using **Assimp**, including textures and materials. Each model is integrated via a `mesh_shape` class.

- 🌌 **Skybox Environment**  
  Created immersive environments using **skyboxes**, with cube-mapped textures rendered via a custom GLSL shader.

- ✨ **Shader Combination**  
  Combined texturing and Phong illumination in custom shaders to render both **lit textured objects** and unlit skybox elements appropriately.

## 🎮 Playable Demo

The project is fully interactive. Users can:

- Control the **camera** (movement and orientation).
- Control the character **Steve** using the keyboard.
- Observe **imported 3D models** and their animations.
- Explore a scene featuring skyboxes, lights, shaders, and textures.

### Camera

| Key        | Action            |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Z / S      | Move forward/back |
| Q / D      | Move left/right   |
| SPACE/CTRL | Move up/down      |
| Mouse      | Look around       |
| SHIFT      | Move faster       |

### Steve (Character)

| Key   | Action                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------ |
| ↑ / ↓ | Move forward/back              |
| ← / → | Rotate body (with animation)   |
| J / L | Rotate body (without animation)|
